<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>
I am facing a problem in obtaining the data for the

<div class="item_body"> 3 Months  </div> tag
containing information about the 'duration' of the Internship
because of a similar tag <div class="item_body" id="start-date-first"> containing
<span class="start_immediately_mobile">Starts&nbsp;immediately</span>

This gives an output:

0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration ->
StartsÂ immediatelyImmediately

Instead of:

0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration -> 3 Months

</p>

EDIT: Problem has been resolved!
