Help required in extracting data from tags containing similar class type 

I am facing a problem in obtaining the data for the duration of Internship from the below mentioned tag:

<div class="item_body"> 3 Months  </div> tag

because of a tag containing similar class:

<div class="item_body" id="start-date-first"> 
     <span class="start_immediately_mobile">Starts&nbsp;immediately</span>

This gives an output:

0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration ->
StartsÂ immediatelyImmediately

Desired Output:

0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration -> 3 Months
