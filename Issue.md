<h4>Help required in extracting data from tags containing similar class type </h4>

<p> I am facing a problem in obtaining the data for the duration of Internship:

<!--<div class="item_body"> 3 Months  </div> tag
containing information about the 'duration' of the Internship
<br>
because of a similar tag 
<br>
<div class="item_body" id="start-date-first"> containing
<span class="start_immediately_mobile">Starts&nbsp;immediately</span>
<br>
This gives an output:
<br>
0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration ->
StartsÂ immediatelyImmediately
<br>
Instead of:

0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration -> 3 Months
-->
</p>
