### **Extracting data from tags containing similar class type** 

I am facing a problem in obtaining the data for the duration of Internship from the below mentioned tag:

`<div class="item_body"> 3 Months  </div>` tag
because of a tag containing similar class:
`<div class="item_body" id="start-date-first">`
     `<span class="start_immediately_mobile">Starts&nbsp;<immediately</span>`

> Output:
<br>
0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration ->
StartsÂ immediatelyImmediately

<br>
> Desired Output:
<br>
0.
Company_Name -> AgentInsights
Job_Role -> Computer Vision
Duration -> 3 Months
